# geometry-calculator
Simple project used for quickly and effectively calculating the areas, circumferences and unknown sides if enough measurements are included. Will update and have many updates planned
## Features

- **Square**: Calculate area and circumference.
- **Rectangle**: Calculate area and circumference.
- **Triangle**: Calculate area, circumference, and the length of the unknown side using the Pythagorean theorem.
- **Circle**: Calculate area and circumference.
- **Equilateral Triangle**: Calculate area, circumference, and side length.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- A terminal or command prompt

I am very open to feedback.

Future plans for this simple project : Additional Shapes: Add support for more geometric shapes such as trapezoids, parallelograms, or 
regular polygons.
                                       Enhanced User Interaction: Improve the user experience by implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt.
                                       Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle incorrect user inputs and provide informative error messages.
                                      
                                       Educational Features: Integrate educational features such as explanations of formulas, interactive examples, or links to related resources
